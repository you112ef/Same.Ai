Security vulnerabilities should **NOT** be reported through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. **DO** Report Privately

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing our security team at:

**Email**: security@your-domain.com

**Subject Line**: `[SECURITY] AI Coding Assistant - [Brief Description]`

### 3. **Include** the Following Information

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a proof of concept
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue

### 4. **Response Timeline**

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 3-5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Depends on complexity and severity
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated with security researchers

### 5. **Coordinated Disclosure**

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- Work with researchers to understand and fix issues
- Provide credit in security advisories
- Coordinate public disclosure timing
- Ensure fixes are available before disclosure

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

Our application includes several security features:

#### 1. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- File upload restrictions and validation
- Path traversal protection
- SQL injection prevention

#### 2. **Authentication & Authorization**
- Session-based authentication
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Project isolation and access control
- Secure session management

#### 3. **API Security**
- CORS configuration
- Helmet.js security headers
- Request size limits
- Input length restrictions

#### 4. **File System Security**
- Project isolation in separate directories
- File type restrictions
- Path validation
- Access control enforcement

#### 5. **AI Integration Security**
- API key protection
- Request validation
- Response sanitization
- Rate limiting on AI calls

### Security Headers

Our application sets the following security headers:

```javascript
// Security headers configuration
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", "wss:", "https:"],
      fontSrc: ["'self'", "https:"],
      objectSrc: ["'none'"],
      mediaSrc: ["'self'"],
      frameSrc: ["'none'"]
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  },
  noSniff: true,
  referrerPolicy: { policy: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" }
}));
```

### Rate Limiting

We implement rate limiting to prevent abuse:

```javascript
// Rate limiting configuration
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.',
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false
});

// Apply to all routes
app.use(limiter);

// Stricter limits for AI endpoints
const aiLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 10, // limit each IP to 10 AI requests per minute
  message: 'Too many AI requests, please try again later.'
});

app.use('/api/ai', aiLimiter);
```
