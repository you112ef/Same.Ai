# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include:

* Using an official e-mail address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Speaking at conferences or meetups
* Participating in hackathons or coding competitions
* Contributing to open source projects

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT METHOD].

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report
it to the community leaders by emailing [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS].

**Do not report incidents in public spaces like discussions, issues or pull
requests.**

### What to Include in Your Report

* **Your contact info** (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* **Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms)** of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well
* **When and where** the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible
* **Your account** of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link
* **Any extra context** you believe existed for the incident
* **If you believe this incident is ongoing**
* **Any other information** you believe we should have

### What Happens After You Report

You will receive an email from the Code of Conduct committee acknowledging receipt
within 24 hours (and will aim to respond much sooner than that).

The committee will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:
* What happened
* Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
* What kind of response is appropriate
* Who should carry out the response

If the incident is determined to be an ongoing situation or a threat to a
community member's safety, the committee's immediate priority will be to protect
that person.

Otherwise, the committee will aim to have a resolution agreed upon within 1 week.
In some cases where a resolution cannot be determined within that time, the
committee will notify the person who filed the report.

Once the committee has a resolution, they will contact the original reporter to
let them know what action (if any) the committee will be taking. The committee
will take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of the
response, but the committee's decision is final.

### Appealing

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision,
contact the community leaders at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS] with your appeal and
they will review the case.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of
Conduct, you should report it to the community leaders with a concise description
of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our
existing governing policies.

## Other Guidelines

### Language Guidelines

* **Use inclusive language**: Avoid language that could be considered offensive
  or exclusionary
* **Be mindful of cultural differences**: What might be acceptable in one
  culture might not be in another
* **Avoid jargon**: Not everyone will understand technical terms or acronyms
* **Use gender-neutral language**: When possible, use "they/them" instead of
  "he/she" or "his/her"

### Communication Guidelines

* **Be respectful**: Even when disagreeing, maintain a respectful tone
* **Listen actively**: Pay attention to what others are saying
* **Ask questions**: If something is unclear, ask for clarification
* **Give constructive feedback**: Focus on the work, not the person
* **Be patient**: Everyone learns at different paces

### Collaboration Guidelines

* **Welcome newcomers**: Help new contributors feel included
* **Share knowledge**: If you know something that could help others, share it
* **Give credit**: Acknowledge the contributions of others
* **Be collaborative**: Work together to find the best solutions
* **Respect boundaries**: Don't push people to contribute more than they want to
